  <h3>User Research</h3>
  <h4>Focusing on user pain points and frustrations, I try to get into the head of the user. Through 
    one-on-one user interviews, surveys, competitor research, and testing the product from rough 
    wireframes, to final hi-fi stages, I can work to fine tune the product to perfection.</h4>
  
  <h3>User Empathy</h3>
  <h4>Getting to the root of the user’s feelings and overall experience is the most beneficial way to deliver a high quality, yet functional product. To better get into the user’s head, I find creating a solid journey maps and user interviews is most beneficial.</h4>
  
  <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
  <h4>Through guerrilla testing, and interviewing users interacting with the wireframes, I can get a better informed idea of how successful the final design will improve pain points. Working on Soter, the Covid travel App, the project changed trajectory after meeting with users when a larger pain point had been relieved. User’s felt the lack of searching by infection rate an oversight on current travel apps during the pandemic. Adjustments to the overall problem statement and persona lead to a better product.</h4>
